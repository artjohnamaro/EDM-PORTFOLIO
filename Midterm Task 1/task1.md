# Midterm Task 1
This portfolio showcases the process of data normalization and cleaning applied to a transactional database. The dataset includes multiple interconnected tables, each structured to enhance data organization and minimize redundancy.

# Step by Step Process

## Step 1:

• Load the raw file

• Fix collumns width and height

• TRIM words and spaces

• Remove Null values

• Remove Duplicates

## Step 2:

• Performed 1NF

• Perform Tablet spilt using 2NF

• Performed 2NF

• Mapped the normalization as a physical data model

## Step 3:
Here is the initial output before I began the data cleaning process.
